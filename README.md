- Majority of the riders are subscribers - 81% of all riders were taken by subscribers.

- Weekday rush hour (7-9AM and 5-7PM) saw the highest number of rides. This is likely because riders were taking bikes to and from work. 

- During the weekend, most of the rides recorded saw the highest number when it was light out (9AM - 8PM). It is likely that most weekend riders do it for leisurely city touring or exercise.

- Weekday gender breakdown: Ride numbers saw similar usage between male and female rides. However, male rider numbers were higher.

- Most riders checked out bikes for 5 minutes
